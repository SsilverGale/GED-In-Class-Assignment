Reflection:

This project utilizes the Observer pattern very well I think. I used it to make a pause and unpause event and thos event interact differently with the UI manager, players script, and cat script differently but all of them need to be able to respond to pausing and unpuasing so it's the perfect choice to add this functionality.
